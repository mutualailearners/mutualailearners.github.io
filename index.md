Welcome! We offer AI tutoring for highschoolers curious about AI or seeking feedback and input on existing AI projects. Our mission is to infuse joy, creativity, and confidence into our students so that they can pursue their visions and ideas for AI. We achieve this by making researchers with cutting-edge, PhD-level AI research experience available to students for regular tutoring sessions. 

Unlike many existing AI education services, we do  *not* seek to simply teach frameworks, rote-skills, and popular jargon to our students. We know that fluency in existing skills and techniques is essential and we have the training to offer these fundamentals to all of our students. We believe that our greatest value add is encouraging the underlying interests and motivations of students to build meaningful AI products or research projects. The AI field is flooded with research and fresh perspectives are desperately needed. Our view is that highschool students have the greatest potential to incubate novel paradigms for applying AI in beneficial, previously unimagined ways. 

We are happy to help students with short-term outcomes such as creating publications, launching products on the internet, or communicating their work more broadly. We aim to balance those concrete outcomes with an emphasis on longer-term, deeper training for those we mentor. The joy of creating truly novel systems, even if they don't garner broader attention from others, sews seeds for a successful long-term career as an innovator and driver of positive change in tech and our world more broadly. 

We bring a flexible, student-centered mindset to our tutoring sessions. Whether students have little coding experience or are bringing existing codebases, our approach is to get students writing AI code on datasets that interest them as quickly as possible. We always seek to hear both student and parent goals for sessions in order to orient outcomes. Our passion is to offer healthy challenge, leaning into opportunities to explore the unknown or pursue risky, strange ideas that arise as we go deeper into development.
