I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Mathematics, advised by [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/)) and [Steve Evans](). I work on applications of machine learning/scalable inference to biology in collaboration with many awesome people! I'm especially interested in furthering the study proteins, protein design, and microbes.
