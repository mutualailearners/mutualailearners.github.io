I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Mathematics, advised by [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) and [Steve Evans](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~evans/). I work on applications of machine learning/scalable inference to biology in collaboration with many awesome people. I'm especially interested in furthering the study proteins, protein design, and microbes.
