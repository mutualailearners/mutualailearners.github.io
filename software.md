__ Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings __  
[TAPE](https://github.com/songlab-cal/tape) is a benchmarking suite for evaluating protein representation learning. We provide a multitask benchmark that assesses how well models capture information about proteins at multiple scales, in the hopes that protein represeentations will become as flexible and powerful as those used for natural language. We also provide the weights for large models pretrained with self-supervision, since the require nontrivial resources to train. Our
[preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/532168)
has more details and results!
