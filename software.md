__Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings__  
[TAPE](https://github.com/songlab-cal/tape) is a benchmarking suite for evaluating protein representation learning. We provide a multitask benchmark to assess how well models capture information about proteins at multiple scales,  pushing protein representations to become as flexible and powerful as those used for natural language. We also provide the weights for large models pretrained with self-supervision. Our
[preprint](tbd)
has more details and results!
