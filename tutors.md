Nicholas Bhattacharya is our main tutor and founder. Nick obtained his PhD from UC Berkeley in May 2022. His PhD work involved applications of machine learning and AI to biology, biotechnology, and medicine. Through this work, he was fortunate to get a broad perspective on the field of AI and the challenges of applying AI systems to unexplored problem domains. This gave him an appreciation for the human creativity required for developing genuinely effective and beneficial AI systems. Nick also has been trained as an educator and tutor, serving for six semesters as a Graduate Student Instructor at UC Berkeley, a tutor at Classroom Matters, and an educator at Black Pine Circle School. Marrying his intense curiosity about computation with his love of education is a dream come true!
